I am currently looking for roles in (or related to) Data Science! Reach out at `f"{first}.{last}0@gmail.com"`

Recently I was a Data Scientist at [Decode_M](https://www.decode-m.com/) where I worked on a variety of projects related to market research, often involving neural network-based analyses of conversations in massive natural language corpora. 

In the summer of 2019 I graduated with a [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu/) from the University of Chicago. While there, I worked in a [developmental psychology lab](https://callab.uchicago.edu/index.html) studying early language learning. 
For my thesis, I assisted in implementing a hierarchical Bayesian model of linguistic alignment, arguably a critical component in the scaffolding of early language abilities. Read a published version [here](../assets/files/denby_cogsci2019.pdf).
